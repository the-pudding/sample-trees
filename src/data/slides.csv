"<span class=methodTitle>Methodology</span>
<span class=method>To build this project, we used the dataset of hundreds of thousands of songs on Genius.com accessible through their API, over 200,000 of which were “connected” in some way by sample, interpolation, cover, or remix. We used this dataset to identify promising examples and then confirmed or revised the relationships in those examples based on cross-checking with other sources, including WhoSampled.com, Spotify, and news media and academic scholarship. The financial, legal, and reputational implications of sampling and interpolation mean that while reproducing or imitating sound is sometimes formally acknowledged by artists, many others times it is not. The connections we propose here are our interpretation, based on one or more of acknowledged credits by the artists, third-party interpretation, or the sonic evidence available to us.</span>
